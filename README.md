# Landing-page

First project using flexbox, making headers, footers, and divided sections on a website. Utilized nesting flexboxes within other flexboxes, and how to format within those. Written in CSS and HTML. Displays my highschool's club information and description, with some inspiration taken from other teams' websites, mainly Team 254.
